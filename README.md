vimscratch
==========

A simple scratch buffer for VIM. You can invoke the scratch buffer with either of the commands `:Scratch` or `:VScratch`. Both of these commands will replace the current buffer if it's unnamed and not modified. Else the first command will open the scratch buffer in a horizontally split window and the latter will open in a vertically split window.
